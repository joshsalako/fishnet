# Fish-NET: AI-Driven Aquaculture Management

This research project aims to enhance traditional aquaculture and fishery management by employing artificial intelligence, focusing on Nigerian catfish farming as a case study. Through a methodical process involving data acquisition, processing, model selection and integration, application development, testing, and validation, this study explores the potential of AI in automating monitoring procedures, consequently improving accuracy, scalability, and efficiency.

## Abstract

This study sought to improve traditional aquaculture and fishery management in terms of accuracy, scalability, and efficiency through the application of artificial intelligence, while using Nigerian catfish farming as a case study. The methodology involves a sequence of steps, including data collection, data processing, model selection and integration, application development, testing, and validation of the effectiveness of the application. The study predominantly drew upon a dataset composed primarily of aerial imagery taken directly above catfish ponds and supplemented by additional data sourced from the internet. Leveraging the power of computer vision and deep learning techniques, the data was processed, and the potential of three distinct, cutting-edge object detection models was investigated using various evaluation metrics to gauge their effectiveness in fish detection tasks. Finally, the most proficient fish detection model was integrated with an object tracking model and deployed as an application, yielding promising outcomes in terms of fish detection and tracking.
